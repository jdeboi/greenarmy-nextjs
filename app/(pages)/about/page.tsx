            <p>The GreenARMY Scorecard is an interactive map exploring the environmental voting record of Louisiana State Representatives during the 2015 political session. The selected bills and amendments represented a wide range of state environmental issues.</p>
            <p>The scorecard was prepared for the GreenARMY, an alliance of groups and individuals led by Russel Honor√© fighting for clean air, clean water, and healthy communities in Louisiana.</p>
            <p>The project was created using D3.js, React, and Next.js by <a href="https://jdeboi.com/">Jenna deBoisblanc</a>.</p>
