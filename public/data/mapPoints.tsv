Restore Louisiana Now	 RLN will initially devote itself to preventing political interference in the lawsuit filed by the Southeast Louisiana Flood Protection Authority-East against 97 oil, gas, and pipeline companies for the destruction of the coast -- the regionâ€™s first line of hurricane protection. The message of these lawsuits is simple; obey the law, keep your word and fix what you broke.  According to a recent poll, 93% of coastal Louisiana residents say that oil, gas and pipeline companies, not taxpayers, should pay to fix their share of the damage to the coastal wetlands.  RLN proudly stands with those residents.	-90.068009	29.960054	Brigade	New Orleans	http://restorelouisiananow.org/sites/all/themes/humble/logo.png	http://restorelouisiananow.org/
Save BR Water	Baton Rouge sits atop a fresh water aquifer deep in the earth that naturally supplies our city with some of the best drinking water in not only the nation, but also the world. However, over pumping is causing large amounts of salt-water intrusion and if action is not taken soon our fresh water will be ruined and we will be forced to find another supply, most likely from the Mississippi River.	-91.086699	30.342265	Brigade	Baton Rouge	http://www.savebrwater.com/images/Infopic_solution.jpg	http://www.savebrwater.com/
